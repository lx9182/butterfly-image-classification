In this notebook [Butterfly_Image_Classification](Butterfly_Image_Classification) we will be doing following steps do build a CNN model to classify butterfly types:

1. The Data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Image Preprocessing
4. A basic CNN model
5. Transfer Learning with VGG16

## Install libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Why do we do this project?

To explore Deep Learning skill to solve image classification problem by using CNN and also transfer learning.

## Summary result

After training 60 epochs with basic CNN and pre-trained model VGG16, here is the result:
